            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But if then every man's Conſcience would joyn with the Preacher, to proſecute the Indictment, and paſs ſentence upon it, and accordingly ſubmit it to due Execution: Ah, how ſoon might ſuch a <hi>National Penitent courſe,</hi> rid this miſerable Land of all thoſe National Sins that have pull'd down theſe National Judgments, which now are Incumbent upon us, till we all, King, Prieſt, and People, ſink under the heavy weight of them!</p>

Some of thoſe reaſons may be worth your notice, becauſe they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern you now at leaſt as much as them: The firſt is, becauſe however thoſe Lands were now abuſed, yet originally <hi>they were giuen to the Augmentation of the Honour of God.</hi> 2. <hi>For the good of Vniverſal Holy Church. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> 3. <hi>Thoſe honeſt Common-wealths-men thought themſelves bound in Conſcience for the Health of their own Souls to preſerve them ſtill to godly uſes:</hi> That ſo 4. <hi>The godly and worthy will of the Givers might be obſerved</hi> in genere, <hi>though it could not then</hi> in ſpecie.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And this fourth Reaſon is in that one Statute repeated twice for failing: May their good Example be a warning to you all, that it may not riſe upon in judgment againſt you, as againſt all the reſt of this Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the <hi>good will of the Dead,</hi> the Pious
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41460:92"/> Founders of <hi>Holy Places</hi> and <hi>Portions,</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Sacred thing,</hi> and therefore ungodly to <hi>alter</hi> and to <hi>fruſtrate</hi> it, was alwaies amongſt all good men held a hainous Crime, as being 1. <hi>Impious to the Dead.</hi> 2. <hi>Injurious to your godly Anceſtors:</hi> and 3. <hi>To your own Poſterity</hi> It will prove no better than <hi>fatal Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore the <hi>Determination</hi> of that wiſe Aſſembly was this, That <hi>neither our Lord the King, nor any other chief Lords of the Eees, nor any Perſons whatſoever ſhould by Eſcheat, or by any other means have or enjoy any of thoſe Lands, but they ſhould be ſtill converted, and charitably diſpoſed of to godly uſes;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were given to the <hi>Prior of the Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital of Saint John of Jeruſalem,</hi> as it were, <hi>in eodem genere,</hi> though changed <hi>in ſpecie.</hi> And yet thoſe <hi>Templars,</hi> to whoſe Lands your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors ſhewed ſo much Religious reſpect, were no Church-men neither, but Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: How much greater then ought your <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Conſcience</hi> to be, for the preſerving of thoſe Lands which belong to the Church directly?</p>
               <p n="11">11. The <hi>ſecond Act of Parliament</hi> you may have amongſt your private Statutes, 2. of <hi>H.</hi> 5. upon the <hi>Diſſolution of Priors Aliens:</hi> The Reaſon expreſſed in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble, was <hi>ad Intentionem, quod divina Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitia in locis praedictis poſſent plus debitè fieri per gentes Anglicanas,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that ſtill <hi>divina Servitia,</hi> was their main care: Therefore
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41460:93"/>
'tis obſervable, that upon the ſame premiſed grounds, immediately at the diſſolution of thoſe <hi>Priors Aliens,</hi> the King kept them not in his own hands, but gave them to other religious uſes: as for inſtance, <hi>To the Monaſtery of Shene,</hi> (which he Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) <hi>to the Dean and Canons of St.</hi> Stephen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. Say again, that thoſe were <hi>Times of Ignorance and Blindneſs,</hi> and that therefore in thoſe times the <hi>Impulſive Cauſe</hi> might be meerly <hi>Superſtitious</hi> in the particulars, yet for all that, the <hi>final Cauſe</hi> was right ſtill in the general, namely, to <hi>honour God,</hi> to <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Service,</hi> &amp;c. as may be ſeen in all their <hi>Evidences</hi> and <hi>Donations,</hi> which ever bear this Clauſe, <hi>Deo &amp; Eccleſiae; To God and the Church,</hi> before there be any mention of any <hi>Saint,</hi> or other ſuppoſed Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous uſe. Now in all Reaſon, although the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive Cauſe</hi> may ceaſe, yet the <hi>Final Cauſe</hi> ceaſeth not, nor the good effect flowing from it.</p>
               <p>So that far ſafer it were to minde that, in a reverend reſpect unto, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of thoſe wiſe men your godly Anceſtors, who took hold of the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Intent</hi> of the Pious Founders, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever after abuſed by the particular Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To the particulars: One doth well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine <hi>Sacriledge a coloured Theft, under pretence of Law:</hi> To begin therefore with the firſt Pretence, 'Tis the <hi>Pretence of Juſtice upon a Delinquent Party,</hi> accuſed of two Crimes. 1. <hi>Of old Colluſion</hi> and fraud at the firſt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Purchaſe of thoſe Church Revenues. 2. <hi>Of another great new Crime, ſince,</hi> called <hi>Malignancy,</hi> which is in plain Engliſh, a compound of <hi>Religion to God, Duty to the Church, Loyalty to the King,</hi> This is that terrible <hi>Chimaera, Malignancy;</hi> the fear whereof, far more than the fear of <hi>God,</hi> or of the <hi>King,</hi> hath already Conquered, and now poſſeſſeth the <hi>Hearts</hi> of the People, the <hi>Heads</hi> of ſome Peers, and the <hi>Tail</hi> of the Prieſts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To prove the firſt the <hi>Colluſion,</hi> they'l

               </p>
               <p n="4">4.

                  <hi>homines legales &amp; pares,</hi> and therefore not parties, or enemies, againſt ſuch <hi>Jurors</hi> the Law will allow of a <hi>principal challenge:</hi> Laſtly, ſo they be tried not <hi>ad placitum,</hi> but by the old ſtanding Rule, <hi>The known Law of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; which, to define out of that known Author, (<hi>Doctor and Student,</hi> Chap. 4.) muſt be grounded, 1. <hi>On the Law of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> 2. <hi>On the Law of God.</hi> 3. <hi>On the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cuſtoms of the Realm.</hi> 4. <hi>On the Principles, or Maxims of the Law.</hi> 5. <hi>On particular Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms.</hi> 6. <hi>On the Statutes, or Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> All which above, have put in their Plea for the Church.</p>

               <p>Fourthly.

But our conſtancy, God be thanked, makes our caſe the better: For, ſhould the King deal worſe with his Innocent, with his Loyal Prieſts?
